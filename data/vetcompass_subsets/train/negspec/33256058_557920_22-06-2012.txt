History-Update: 
Doing really well, coughed a small cough the day she came back and then no coughing since.
Examination: 
Lungs do not sound much different, they are harsher thatn most cat lungs, but it seems worse as she gets so stressed here. O thinking about sending the xrays off, but he will hold fire for now and if coughing returns likely will.
