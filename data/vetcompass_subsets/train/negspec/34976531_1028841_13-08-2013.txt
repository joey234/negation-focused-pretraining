Looks like liver is working ok, given the BAST, so production of albumin would be expected to be ok from a liver point of view.
Normal UPCr makes it less likely to have protein losing enteropathy.

Therefore low albumin coming from PLE or third space losses.

Could the fluid in abdo be inflammatory in nature?
Would advise sample of ascitic fluid to rule out inflammatory fluid, then if purely hypoalbuminaemia from assumed PLE, start on zantac and antepsin while continuing abios.

Start back on steroids and leave off lomustine for now.
