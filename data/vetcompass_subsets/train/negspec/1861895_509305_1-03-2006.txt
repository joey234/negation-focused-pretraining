MORPHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS

      Superficial interstitial dermatitis.

      AETIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS

      This dermatitis pattern is common and of low diagnostic power,
      part of the pathology of many diseases as well as indicating
      parasites/ allergens/ irritants. This is most consistent with
      primary barrier dysfunction and irritant and hypersensitivity
      reactions of atopic dermatitis syndrome including contact
      reactions.

      COMMENTS

      Atopic dermatitis syndrome clinical signs are often only
      pruritus and erythema and the mild pathology reflects this.
      Eosinophils are not often seen. They may degranulate very
      rapidly so they are not seen in routine histological sections
      but many atopic reactions are mediated by other cells. The
      pathology is not diagnostic but this is the usual diagnosis when
      the clinical history is compatible.

      Atopy is genetic and therefore recurrent and incurable.
      Explanation of the interconnecting roles of hyper-reaction to
      triggers of allergens and irritants and susceptibility to
      microbial skin colonisation is helpful in communicating the
      multifactorial nature of atopic dermatitis syndrome to the
      owner. Appropriate skin care with cleansers and moisturisers and
      zinc and essential fatty acid supplements improve barrier
      function. Antibiotics help when there is pyoderma and
      immunotherapy reduces frequency of superficial pyoderma. Many
      animals react to multiple triggers such as house-dust mites,
      fleas, food and drugs.

Assessment: preliminary results consistent with working dx of atopic dermatitis. Awaiting serology results. Will need to commence EFA supplementation + antihistamines and malaseb washes. May need to consider use of atopica also.
