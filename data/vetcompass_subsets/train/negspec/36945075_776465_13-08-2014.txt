Reason: Unwell
Appointment Notes: Overdue reminders
History-Update: went to kennels 2 weeks ago, during the stay D started. Was taken to the vets (see history) where the vet adv not to use plt tablets. Instead tramadol was given (with clavaseptin, metronidazole, omeprazole, panacur). Tramadol is not working, dog in much pain.

Examination: BAR but can't stand for a long time, very stiff when walking. Mm pink and moist, crt 1 sec, smln ok, chest fine but hr elevated - 160-180 (not sure as panting), abdomen nad. Didn't want to eat today, only had small amouint of pasta.

Adv may need to go on plt back again as prob not eating because of pain. Adv to give plt tablet again as were working better, cover in a piece of meat, triangle cheese, other food so it's not on empty stomach. O struggling with tablets but adv omeprazole and abs most important.
