Reason: Prob With Mouth - Lcr
Appointment Notes: Overdue reminders

Similar to last visit - not eaten for a few days, no sickness/diarrhea, drinking a lot but that is normal for him. Still very active. Seems to want food and calls for it but then won't eat it. 
Exam all fine except he does have dental disease and hyperplasia/sores behind his molars. 
Advsied dental is best way for long term solution. Would prefer to do bloods pre-op to rule out kidney/other concurrent disease. Owenrs happy with this - estimate Â£300 with lots of extractions.
