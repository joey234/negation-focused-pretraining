17:42:38 Nikki F Parnell - History- O called and wanted exact cost for cat spay for tomorrow. MG did an estimate. O does not want pain relief to take home or food. Explained would need to be on a bland diet of boiled chicken/fish and rice or we have tinned equivalents, but O doesnt want these. Didnt want buster collar but stressed the importance of this to stop animal licking wound causing infection. O is going to be keeping Lilly in cage after op but explained she will still be able to reach wound. Agreed to buster collar so MG did estimate for buster collar and spay and no other extras. 

If O asks about extras when brings Lilly in please can we explain the costs for these and give O a total for the end of the day. 

Confirmed pre op with O. np
