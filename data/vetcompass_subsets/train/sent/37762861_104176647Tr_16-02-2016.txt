Reason: Remove Wire
Appointment Notes: bb

Been well at home, starved overnight, been eating reasonably well, passing faeces EOD, on lactulose permanently to help with this, hasnt been constipated since.  Chest ausc nad, lost 0.7kg since last weighed, BCS ~8/9 still, adv gradual wt loss good but dont want any sudden dramatic wt loss.  Jaw seems stable but struggled to check with o holding, adv will check again before removing wire.

Tried checking jaw but cat wouldnt tolerate conscious.  Premed acp/bup, induced propoflo, maintained iso/o2.  Jaw not fused, still unstable.  Smell of infec from area.  Wire on outside where flush with skin has dug in and caused pressure sore, full thickness.  STO, adv not removing wire today as still holding jaw in good alignment but not yet fused, poss due to chronicity of frac, or also due to infec.  Adv start ABs, moved wire sticking out ventrally to other side so pressure sore can heal.  Start met, cat wont tolerate tabletting so LA AB inj.  Re-ex 2wks, poss look to remove wire after this if fused.  Otherwise second sx?  Referral if not healing?
