15:40:00 Lauren Gale - History- weight clinic, Starting to get some shape to her body. Not able to measure her today. O will measure at home, reweigh in a months time. Keep feeding the same, only using metabolic food now, no treats. Maybe split daily amount into 4 lots to make lily think shes being fed. suggested keeping active via making her search for her daily amount (large rock in bowl to make her work for the pieces of food - large enough so she cant eat it!!) Much more active and making good progress .lg
