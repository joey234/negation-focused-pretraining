Removed bandage. Tip of tail looks great, dry, scabbed over and no pain on manipulation/palpation.

Plan at this point to trial leaving off. Review in 4-5dd again, hopefully for sign off. Adv if starts traumatising tail again, MUST see immediately for bandage replacement.

Discussed signover/PTS again as O's considering this if doesn't heal


O returned approx 30-60mins later. Phoebe was sitting on lap and then suddeny attacked tail again, drawing blood. O placed temporary dressing and returned to practice. O feels needs to signover/PTS as struggling to cope with ongoing costs etc.

Transfer of Ownership form completed. Adv will attempt to contact charities today/ next week. If unable to re-home will PTS.
