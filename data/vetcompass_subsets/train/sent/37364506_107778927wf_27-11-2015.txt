Reason: Recheck
Appointment Notes: Overdue reminders

Ow reported not using the leg as in pain due to the bandage rubbing onto the dorsal hock. Inflamed lesion present on area with mild scabbing.
Wound healing surprisingly well and lovely gran tissue present.
Re-bandaged but not upt to the hock and resee in 3 days with NURSE. If bandage slip away can leave uncovered but would put just a sock on it without taping it.

Bandage came off at the desk - to leave as it is but at home to put a sock on it and when out for a walk to wear mikki-boot.
