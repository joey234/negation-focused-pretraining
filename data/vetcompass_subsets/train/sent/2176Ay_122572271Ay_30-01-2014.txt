18:53:08 Katie Leworthy - History- stranguria and haematuria again.  vomitted once this afternoon.  up until today was doing well.  eating renal diet well, looks like has put on weight (unfortuantely cat scales not working).
bladder not palpable in consult but was tense on abdo palpation.
discussed with o - although continual infections could be secondary to renal disease and/or stress haven't taken rads/scan so can't rule out uroliths/neoplasia etc.  o would be interested in doing these but wondering if could pay in 2/3 installments.  to discuss with OW.
