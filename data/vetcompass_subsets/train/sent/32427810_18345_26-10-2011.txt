O is now disputing bill and doesn't want to pay as dog has died.
Feels didn't know extent of surgery and that only conker was removed so he would have paid if dog had survived but doesn't see why he must pay so much as dog has died.

I've advised O that the risks of surgery was discussed with his wife and this fb was there for 5 days and caused significant inflammation and infection to gut and while tragic, O was advised that the 48hrs post surgery were critical.
We agreed on a 50% discount with the bill to be paid in full by end of October.
