Appointment Notes: Re Check sb

Doing really well. Virtually gone just fibrous corn now from scab. This may just be scarring now but concern that not fully gone and may flare up once Abs stopped.
Removed scab and flushed with hibi.Not getting any puss out now. 
Continue ABs for another week (still has enough for a few days at home)

If flares up again then suggests will not resolve without more invasive procedures/surgery. 
Is a school G.Pig and realistically if has further problems they will decide to pts.
