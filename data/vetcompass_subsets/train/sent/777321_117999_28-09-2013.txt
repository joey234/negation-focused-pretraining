Received email from Amelie regarding dermatophyte test, but is not where she put it so unfortunately has been mislaid. 
Spoken to o at length and explained that unfortunately results have gone missing, apologised lots and offered FOC checkup and retest due to inconvenience.
Please can we do full coat brushing and s3end to RVC though for derm check as I think gives better results, but NO CHARGE PLEASE
