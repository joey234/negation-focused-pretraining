Reason: 2nd Opinion
Appointment Notes: to see BW pls (would like to see a permanant vet who is good with older cats) - diagnosed with lung condition (? - o a little unclear on details) at current vet but quoted Â£1600 for investigations and would like a second opinion) - quoted for extended consult. mc
History :: 
Gallop rhythm and tachycardia noted at booster in summer 2012. 
Presented dyspnoeic and tchycardic with gallop to prev vet on 16th Sept (fine at booster on 3rd Sept this year). Given frusemide inj and disp frusemide (2mg/kg TID for 3 days then 2mg/kg BID) and benazepril tablets 2.5mg SID after offering invx.

O reports much better yesterday on meds and back to normal today, breathing has been fine at home. Wanted to discuss further invx as unable to afford estimate from prev vet.

Examination:: 
BAR, well hydrated. LN WNL. No obv goitre. Teeth good. Thrx ausc HR=PR=240bpm but gallop rhythm present. Concerned re tachycardia and tachypnoea here though has been fine at home (quite active/anxious here). Abd palp relaxed, NAD obv. 

Assessment :: 
Likely in congestive heart failure though stable.

Treatment Plan:: 
Disc further invx with O - adv echo and thrx rads next step, ideally basic blood profile and TT4 though min suspicion of this best to rule out and suggest BP checks. Will disc with DDH re booking for procedure. Cont current meds at present, may need to introduce aspirin at home once echo performed.
Given estimate, please book scan for DDH next week.
