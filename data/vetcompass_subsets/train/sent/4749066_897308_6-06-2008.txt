Mass in left hock region.

Histological examination shows a large well circumscribed
lobular, cystic mass occupying the dermis and extending into the
subcutis. The mass is formed by a proliferation of basaloid
epithelial cells in islands and trabeculae, and forming a
multilayered lining to the cysts. The cells are often
elongated. Amorphous acidophylic substance, degenerate cells
and pigment deposits are present in the cyst lumena. Clusters
of melanocytes are present in the stroma and cell sheets. The
lesion is complete in this section.

Diagnosis. Trichoblastoma - trabecular / cystic type.

Prognosis. This is a benign neoplasm. Trichoblastomas are
common in dogs and fairly common in cats. They were previously
classed as basal cell tumours. Most tumours are 1-2cm in
diameter but larger masses are sometimes found. They are
usually well circumscribed. Complete excision should be
curative.
