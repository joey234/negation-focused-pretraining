Reason: Senior Check
Examine: Owner very happy with progress on Metacam, good improvement re mobilty. 
Discussed senior diet and Seraquin versus J/D - owner opted for J/D diet (will bring Senior back for refund as only bought it a week ago, when sees ST 31.1 and will also take the J/d then.)
Discussed use of raised feed/water bowls - owner will do this.
Only has one room in the house with wooden floors - advise use large rugs.
Flossy no longer goes upstairs - but advise baby gate just in case.
Flossy does not like water therefore hydrotherapy out of the question.
Discussed exercise regime - currently allowed off the lead for most of the walk. Advise use warm up/cool down period, walk on flat ground only and stick to a routine, no extra long walks at the weekend.
Informed owner of 6 monthly blood and urine testing as she on Metacam - owner keen to do this.
Discussed bedding - owner needs to provide a thicker padded bedding for Flossy.
Owner very receptive to all ideas as she has seen such good progress with Flossy already.
Plan: recheck ST 1 week to bring Senior diet back  for refund then take a bag of J/D.
