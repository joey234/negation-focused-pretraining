Biopsy results: 

Skin biopsy confirms a mast cell tumour, which correlates with the
FNA results. The tumour is histologically low-grade as judged by the lack of
cellular atypia and mitotic activity shown to be significant in prognosis on the new
two-tier grading system pioneered by Kiupel and colleagues in 2011. However the
deep location of the tumour in the skin and subcutis, and incomplete deep margins,
mean that local recurrence is a risk and repeat surgery with wider margins is
recommended in the event of that complication.

Confirmed MCT, likely low grade. 

Would justify excision of 2cm margins on this basis. 
Called O tro discuss all. Adv aim for curative surgery with 2cm margins, est @ Â£700. O to book with LOR. Discussed further staging as an option. No rota yet next week, O in tomorrow for ROS, can check then. Otherwise LOR will call to book op when rota back.
