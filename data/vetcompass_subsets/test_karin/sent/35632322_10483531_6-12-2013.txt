Mrs Millington called enquiring about the frontline treatment that she had given to Inka last week.
She has since found three more ticks that seemed black and slightly shrivelled and was just wanting to check that the treatment would be working.
Checked with HS and advised that the frontline will be working - and that it wouldnt stop ticks attaching but would definitely kill them off.
