Lovely lad, no health concerns at present. Doing really well at home. Been to training school and really enjoyed it. Lump found on his side previously has vanished now. 
Smashing lad, really like him. Applied advocate today, no worries with Obi, booking in for castrate when o' got a date suitable. Two symmetrical testicles present but is feeling really randy lately! FC
