Reason: Recheck And Booster if Can Have RF
Appointment Notes: Overdue reminders

Nail bed hasn't improved, possibly gotten worse, clipped some more fur - she is very sore to touch the area, owners have been cleaning with hibi at home, on one occasion the area bled quite badly. Metacam helped. Infection involves digits 3,4 and 5 now. Skin appears to be almost purple and very friable. Not spread to any other feet. 

Will switch to cephacare and continue with bathing at home to keep it clean. 
INI next week may need to consider culture/biopsy as worry about immune mediated causes.
