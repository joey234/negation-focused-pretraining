O noticed skin tear to caudomedial L hind proximal to hock.
Oozing serous fluid and thickened dry skin edges. Advise not fresh and so not sutured. Clipped, cleaned and stapled to reduce size of hole but allow drainage.
Recheck 3 days. If not healing by second intention, then can consider surgery.
