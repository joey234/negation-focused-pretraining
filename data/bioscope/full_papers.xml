					<sentence id="S1.18">Stop codon readthrough is a phenomenon in which the translation process does <xcope id="X1.18.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.18.1">not</cue> terminate at a stop codon</xcope>, and an amino acid is inserted there instead 12.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.19">In some cases, the inserted amino acid is <xcope id="X1.19.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.19.1">not</cue> one of the 20 amino acids</xcope> but a noncanonical one.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.20">Two such amino acids have been discovered to date: selenocysteine 34 and pyrrolysine 56.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.21">Because each of them have specialized tRNA genes for decoding and can be considered extensions of the standard genetic code, they are called the 21st and 22nd amino acids, respectively.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.22">Selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid, is encoded by stop codon UGA, and organisms that use selenocysteine have been found from all three domains of life.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.23">Its insertion into UGA is directed by SECIS (selenocysteine insertion sequence) elements, a stem-loop structure on the selenoprotein mRNA.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.24">Along with the progress of genome sequencing projects, computational prediction methods of selenocysteine-containing proteins (selenoproteins) have been developed by several research groups 78910, and the repertoire of selenoproteins has been greatly expanded 1112.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.25">Pyrrolysine, the 22nd amino acid encoded by stop codon UAG, was recently discovered from a methanogenic archaea 56.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.26">Currently, only methanogenic archaea of the order Methanosarcinales and one bacterium are considered to utilize pyrrolysine 13.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.27">The limited phylogenetic distribution of pyrrolysine <xcope id="X1.27.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.27.2">suggests</cue> that its incorporation into the genetic code of methanogen is relatively recent, and the insertion mechanism of a novel amino acid <xcope id="X1.27.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.27.1">can</cue> evolve in a shorter period of time than anticipated</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.28">This <xcope id="X1.28.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.28.1">raises an interesting question</cue>:: ""Is there a 23rd amino acid"</xcope>?".</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.29">If such an amino acid is discovered, it will deepen our understanding of the evolution and diversity of the genetic code.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.30">Because genome sequences of various prokaryotes are available today, there will be a chance to discover the novel amino acid via analysis of these genomes.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.31">Since both the 21st and 22nd amino acids are encoded by stop codons, the prime suspect is other stop codons (e.g. stop codon UAA), although the possibility of sense codons certainly remains.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.32">Using this clue, computational screening methods of the 23rd amino acid can be designed.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.33">Recently, Lobanov et al. addressed this problem by searching tRNAs with anticodons corresponding to stop codons 14.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.34">They analyzed 146 prokaryotic genomes, but <xcope id="X1.34.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.34.1">no</cue> likely tRNA of the novel amino acid was detected</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.35">They concluded that the 23rd amino acid <xcope id="X1.35.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.35.1">would</cue> have a limited phylogenetic distribution, if it exists</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.36">However, programs for tRNA identification are based on the features of known tRNAs and do not necessarily perform well on unknown ones.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.37">Actually, tRNASec and tRNAPyl have unusual secondary structures 515 and often escape detection by programs <xcope id="X1.37.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.37.1">without</cue> special consideration</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.38">Lobanov et al. thus developed a sensitive search method to deal with this problem, but they also admitted that it <xcope id="X1.38.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.38.2">would</cue> <xcope id="X1.38.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.38.1">fail</cue> to identify highly unusual tRNAs</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.39">There is another approach to searching for the 23rd amino acid.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.40">By enumerating ORFs that have an inframe stop codon from genomes and examining their evolutionary conservation, candidate proteins can be predicted.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.41">Because such an ORF-based study is independent from the tRNA analysis, it can <xcope id="X1.41.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.41.1">either</cue> identify candidate organisms missed by the previous study <cue type="speculation" ref="X1.41.1">or</cue> strengthen its negative conclusion</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.42">Here we report a comprehensive analysis of prokaryotic ORFs that contain an inframe stop codon.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.43">Through enumeration of theoretical ORFs and inspection of their evolutionary conservation, candidates of readthrough proteins were predicted.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.44">They contained many of the known proteins with stop-codon-encoded amino acids, but almost no novel candidates were identified.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.45">Therefore, <xcope id="X1.45.1">the unknown amino acid, if it is encoded by a stop codon, is <cue type="speculation" ref="X1.45.1">unlikely</cue> to exist in the current databases of microbial genomes</xcope>.</sentence>

				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S1.49">In this study, we focus on theoretical ORFs with one inframe stop codon, termed "interrupted ORFs" (iORFs) (Figure 1a).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.50">If we enumerate all iORFs from microbial genomes, most of the readthrough genes will be included in them.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.51">However, the vast majority of the enumerated iORFs will be biologically meaningless.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.52">To filter out such meaningless iORFs, we required the iORFs to have at least one homolog in other genomes, because evolutionary conservation of primary sequence is a strong indicator of functional importance.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.53">However, this condition is <xcope id="X1.53.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.53.1">not</cue> sufficient</xcope>, since two major problems remain:: pseudogenes and two adjacent genes.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.54">The first problem is that even if an iORF has homologs in other species, it <xcope id="X1.54.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.54.2">could</cue> be <xcope id="X1.54.1">a pseudogene <cue type="speculation" ref="X1.54.1">or</cue> a product of sequencing error</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.55">The second problem is that adjacent genes on the same reading frame <xcope id="X1.55.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.55.1">may</cue> satisfy the condition of conserved iORFs</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.56">In particular, gene pairs within an operon are problematic because their gene arrangement is often conserved.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.57">If <xcope id="X1.57.2">the intergenic distance between two genes in an operon <cue type="speculation" ref="X1.57.2">happens</cue> to be a multiple of three</xcope>, they <xcope id="X1.57.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.57.1">look like</cue> a conserved readthrough gene</xcope>.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S1.60">(a) Schematic illustration of an interrupted ORF (iORF).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S1.62">Boxes denote iORFs, and &#215; indicates the inframe stop codon.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.63">Shaded regions represent actual protein-coding regions.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.64">If an iORF codes a readthrough protein, BLAST hits from other organisms will cover the inframe stop codon.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.65">In contrast, if the iORF consists of two adjacent genes, many hits that do <xcope id="X1.65.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.65.1">not</cue> cover the inframe stop codon</xcope> will be found.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.66">To discriminate them from true readthrough genes, evolutionary information was exploited.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.67">In order to eliminate pseudogenes and sequencing errors, conservation of iORFs and their inframe stop codons was examined.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.68">Since pseudogenes are less conserved, and sequencing errors are relatively rare events, they will <xcope id="X1.68.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.68.1">not</cue> have homologous iORFs in other species</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.69">Even if they do, the position or type (UAA, UAG or UGA) of their inframe stop codons will <xcope id="X1.69.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.69.1">not</cue> coincide</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.70">In this way, they can be eliminated as candidates.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.71">A drawback of this criterion is that it limits the target of our study to readthrough genes conserved across two or more species.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.72">In other words, species-specific readthrough genes are <xcope id="X1.72.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.72.1">not</cue> in the scope of this study</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.73">To address the second problem, adjacent gene pairs were filtered out by examining boundaries of sequence alignments between iORFs and its homologs (Figure 1b).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.74">The stop-codon-encoded amino acids of prokaryotes are usually located inside domains, the units of evolutionary sequence conservation.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.75">Therefore, the aligned regions of readthrough proteins contain their inframe stop codon.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.76">Based on this observation, each iORF was required to have:: (i) at least one homolog from other organisms that covers the inframe stop codon and (ii) <xcope id="X1.76.2"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.76.2">no</cue> homolog that does <xcope id="X1.76.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.76.1">not</cue> cover the stop codon</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.77">Note that, however, if the whole length of an iORF was used as a query sequence, this procedure will erroneously discard multidomain readthrough proteins.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S2.26">The low coverage and variable quality of the experimental interaction datasets have prompted many groups to investigate computational methods to predict interactions or to determine the most likely interactions seen in the high-throughput datasets.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S2.27">The different approaches to predict interactions can be grouped into five main categories:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S2.28">1) Predictors based on sequence and structure exploit the observation that some pairs of sequence motifs, domains and structural families tend to interact preferentially.</sentence>

				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S3.214">The field of motif finding is saturated with a large number of algorithms representing myriad search strategies, objective functions and motif models.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.215">Yet remarkably, performance comparisons consistently reveal disappointing performance for motif finders and <xcope id="X3.215.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X3.215.1">fail</cue> to find any statistical significance between them</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.216">A brief survey of the per-regulon results of these performance comparisons yields two key observations: (1) there are many regulons for which a large number of programs find a small portion of the binding sites (though not necessarily the same portion); and (2) every program has a respectable number of "wins" (i.e. every program is the best existing program on some handful of regulons 145678.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.217">Such observations are common in many machine learning applications, and are the direct result of complex search spaces that force restrictions on either the search strategy or the representation of the solution space (in this case, the motif model used to represent the motifs).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.218">For example, YMF and RSAT are guaranteed to find the optimal solutions in their motif space (fixed-length motifs with limited degeneracies), but that space is limited to the point that optimality provides no clear advantage over the other methods.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.219">Conversely, the PWM-based methods have an apparently more powerful motif model 17, but their search strategies <xcope id="X3.219.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X3.219.1">cannot</cue> guarantee optimality</xcope> and often terminate at local optima.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.220">The HLK ensemble method 4 successfully exploits the first key observation above.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.221">By running the same (stochastic) algorithm multiple times and using a voting method, those subsequences of the binding sites that are repeatedly reported become clear while the spurious bases are eliminated.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.222">Hu and colleagues report that this method increased accuracy and <xcope id="X3.222.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.222.2">proposed</cue> that their approach <xcope id="X3.222.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.222.1">may</cue> prove effective when running different algorithms as well</xcope></xcope> 4.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.223">The limitation arises, however, in regulons where only one program has a high accuracy and the others <xcope id="X3.223.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X3.223.1">fail</cue> to find any portion of the binding sites</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.224">In such cases, it is <xcope id="X3.224.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.224.1">likely</cue> that a voting-based ensemble will follow the crowd and fail to find the true binding site</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.225">The second observation, that all motif finders win some number of regulons and often perform roughly the same on average, is broadly consistent with a theorem in the Machine Learning field referred to as the No Free Lunch Theorem 1819.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.226">Briefly, this theorem states that, averaged over all datasets, the performance of all search algorithms are exactly the same, with the corollary that two algorithms will have the exact same number of wins in relation to each other.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.227">In practice, this theorem argues for the use of specialized domain knowledge 20, where available, and <xcope id="X3.227.3"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.227.3">may</cue> <xcope id="X3.227.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.227.2">suggest</cue> that similar average performance across a diversity of approaches is an <xcope id="X3.227.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.227.1">indication</cue> of the diversity of the datasets themselves</xcope></xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.228">Thus, motif finders designed for one class of motifs will win on regulons containing those motifs, but will perform poorly on other regulons, while more general motif finders will <xcope id="X3.228.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.228.1">tend</cue> to have more consistently mediocre performance</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.229">In this light, <xcope id="X3.229.3">SCOPE <cue type="speculation" ref="X3.229.3">can</cue> be seen as leveraging the second key observation by embracing the No Free Lunch Theorem</xcope>:: <xcope id="X3.229.2"><cue type="negation" ref="X3.229.2">rather than</cue> boost average performance by taking the average results of three general purpose algorithms</xcope>, SCOPE uses highly specialized algorithms and <xcope id="X3.229.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.229.1">assumes</cue> each will perform strongly on some regulons and weakly on others (and that the unified scoring metric can tell the difference)</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.230">The working <xcope id="X3.230.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.230.1">hypothesis</cue> is, in effect, that the local maxima are predictable (corresponding to one of three motif classes) and exploitable</xcope> (we can find the local maxima in each class and choose whichever is higher).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.231">Consistent with this hypothesis, there was very little overlap among the component algorithms of SCOPE (each wins about 20 of the 78 regulons, with very few ties) and, by taking the maximum score from those three local maxima, SCOPE tended to choose the motif with the highest accuracy in a clear majority of the cases (66%, compared to 33% for a random learning rule).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.232">Furthermore, SCOPE not only significantly outperformed its components on this dataset, it also outperformed a number of general purpose algorithms that seek to find the global maximum in a single pass.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.233">Of course, based on the No Free Lunch Theorem, SCOPE's performance averaged over all theoretically possible datasets will still converge to that of the other motif finding approaches (including random guessing).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.234">As the physical properties of transcription factors will inevitably constrain the structure of their binding sites, biologically relevant datasets comprise a subset of the space of all theoretically possible sequences.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.235">Our test set of 78 regulons was selected in a blinded manner (for details, see Additional file 1, section S3), thus these results <xcope id="X3.235.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.235.1">suggest</cue> the generalizability of SCOPE's use of domain knowledge on biologically relevant datasets from these species</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.236"><xcope id="X3.236.1">These observations are <cue type="negation" ref="X3.236.1">not</cue> offered as definitive proof that there are only three classes of motifs</xcope>; rather, they show that power can be gained by identifying distinct motif classes and combining specialized algorithms with a unified scoring rule.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S3.238">For example, Zinc finger transcription factors have been demonstrated to bind three triplets of nucleotides which overlap at their third base positions 21.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.239">This observation <xcope id="X3.239.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.239.1">could</cue> be leveraged by a search algorithm that explicitly searches for motifs matching this unique structure</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.240">Thus, <xcope id="X3.240.1">all nondegenerate triplets in a set of upstream regions <cue type="speculation" ref="X3.240.1">could</cue> be scored</xcope> and the highest-scoring triplets combined into a single five-mer with a two-base degeneracy (corresponding to the IUPAC characters R,Y, W, S, K or M) at the middle position.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.241"><xcope id="X3.241.1">The highest-scoring five-mers <cue type="speculation" ref="X3.241.1">could</cue> then be combined with the highest scoring triplets to generate a seven-mer with two-base degeneracies at positions three and five</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.242">Provided the appropriate Bonferroni correction is applied for this new class of motifs, <xcope id="X3.242.1">these motifs <cue type="speculation" ref="X3.242.1">may</cue> be easily compared with the results from BEAM, PRISM and SPACER</xcope>, thereby extending the SCOPE ensemble to include a fourth class of motifs.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.243">We note, however, that as more methods are added to SCOPE, it will be increasingly difficult to devise a scoring metric that can accurately choose the best result from among the components.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.244">SCOPE <xcope id="X3.244.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.244.1">may</cue> also serve as a complementary approach to the HLK method</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.245">For example, the parameters of many methods can be set to search for specific classes of motifs (such as bipartite versus non-bipartite motifs).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.246">Thus, analogous to the ensemble method described in this paper, one <xcope id="X3.246.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.246.1">may</cue> build a hierarchical ensemble that first searches each motif class by the HLK method using a number of algorithms or random restarts, and then uses the SCOPE method to choose the best result from among the motif classes</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.247">One constraint associated with such an approach is the run-time.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.248">A second constraint associated with a hierarchical ensemble learning method is the multiplicative increase in the number of parameters associated with it, though <xcope id="X3.248.1">this problem <cue type="speculation" ref="X3.248.1">may</cue> be ameliorated by the use of parameter-free algorithms that employ restricted search spaces</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.249">An important factor to consider when taking the best of multiple runs is the relative size of the search space.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.250">Certainly to maintain statistical validity, some correction must be made for multiple hypothesis testing.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.251">Furthermore, the effects of multiple testing <xcope id="X3.251.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.251.1">may</cue> bias the results in favor of one of the component algorithms</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.252">To ensure statistical validity and avoid such a bias, we developed a simple Bonferroni-like correction, which penalized every proposed motif proportional to its length and degree of degeneracy, resulting in a modest improvement of 8% in SCOPE's accuracy.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.253">Although our test set of 78 regulons gave us enough power to find significance between SCOPE and its components or other algorithms, it did <xcope id="X3.253.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X3.253.1">not</cue> provide enough power to disentangle the effects of small improvements (such as the Bonferroni correction, the objective function that takes position bias into account, or scoring motifs based off one or both strands), especially in the rigorous cross-validation framework necessary to decipher precisely which aspects contribute significantly to the performance</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.254">Nevertheless, as larger datasets become available, SCOPE's efficient search strategy makes it an ideal platform for exploring the effect of focused improvements to the motif finding approach described, such as the use of complex objective functions that <xcope id="X3.254.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X3.254.1">may</cue> better approximate biological significance</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.255">The comparisons to other motif finding programs in this study are provided to place SCOPE's performance in the broader context of the motif finding field, particularly when viewed from the standpoint of the practicing "bench" biologist.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.256">Any performance comparison must be interpreted with caution, since the results are highly dependent on the dataset used, the conditions of the testing and the metrics used for evaluation.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.257">With this in mind, we sought to evaluate a wide representation of motif finders on a large number of regulons using performance metrics consistent with previous studies 67.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.258">To the best of our knowledge, this dataset represents the largest set of biologically relevant regulons used for performance comparisons to date.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.259">Whereas previous performance comparisons attempt to optimize the parameters of the programs in question 467 or allow expert users to tune their own programs and manually filter both the input and output 5 we intentionally made our comparisons between programs <xcope id="X3.259.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X3.259.1">without</cue> manually optimizing any parameters for any species so as to emulate typical use conditions</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.260">Our comparison thus complements the recent large scale study of Tompa et al., who gauge performance under optimal conditions on semi-synthetic data sets 5, as well as the study of Hu et al., who explore the effect of parameter optimization on a handful of popular motif finders 4.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S5.13">Cell-to-cell signaling mediated by receptors of the Notch (N) family has been implicated in various developmental decisions in organisms ranging from nematodes to mammals [1].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.14">N is well-known for its role in lateral inhibition, a key patterning process that organizes the regular spacing of distinct cell types within groups of equipotent cells.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.15">Additionally, N mediates inductive signaling between cells with distinct identities.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.16">In both signaling events, N signals via a conserved mechanism that involves the cleavage and release from the membrane of the N intracellular domain that acts as a transcriptional co-activator for DNA-binding proteins of the CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-2 (CSL) family [2].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.17">Two transmembrane ligands of N are known in Drosophila, Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser) [3].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.18">Dl and Ser have distinct functions.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.19">For instance, Dl (but <xcope id="X5.19.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X5.19.1">not</cue> Ser)</xcope> is essential for lateral inhibition during early neurogenesis in the embryo [4].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.20">Conversely, Ser (but <xcope id="X5.20.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X5.20.1">not</cue> Dl)</xcope> is specifically required for segmental patterning [5].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.21">Some developmental decisions, however, require the activity of both genes: Dl and Ser are both required for the specification of wing margin cells during imaginal development [6,7,8,9,10].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.22"><xcope id="X5.22.2">These different requirements for Dl and Ser <cue type="speculation" ref="X5.22.2">appear</cue> to primarily result from their non-overlapping expression patterns <xcope id="X5.22.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X5.22.1">rather than</cue> from distinct signaling properties</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.23">Consistent with this interpretation, <xcope id="X5.23.1">Dl and Ser have been <cue type="speculation" ref="X5.23.1">proposed</cue> to act redundantly in the sensory bristle lineage where they are co-expressed</xcope> ([11]; note, however, that results from another study have indicated a non-redundant function for Dl in the bristle lineage [12]).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S6.53">Using protein sequences of seven known Transib TPases (Transib1 through Transib4 and Transib1_AG through Transib3_AG from D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, respectively) [17] as queries in a standard BLASTP search against all GenBank proteins, we found that the approximately 60-aa C-terminal portion of the Transib2_AG TPase was 35%-38% identical to the C-terminal portion of the RAG1 core (Figure S1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.54">However, this similarity was only marginally significant (E = 0.07 where the E-value is an expected number of sequences matching by chance; Table 1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.55">In another search against GenBank, using PSI-BLAST [18] (see Materials and Methods) with the Transib2_AG TPase as a query, we found that two unclassified proteins (GenBank gi 30923617 and 30923765; annotated as hypothetical proteins) and RAG1s constituted the only group of any GenBank proteins similar to the Transib2_AG TPase (Table 1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.56">The statistical significance of similarity between the TPase and RAG1s was measured by Ei = 0.025, where Ei is the E-value threshold for the first inclusion of RAG1 sequences into the PSI-BLAST iterations [18] (Materials and Methods).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.57">The observed improvement in significance of the Transib/RAG1 similarity (from E = 0.07 in BLASTP to Ei = 0.025 in PSI-BLAST; Table 1) was due to the fact that both 151-aa and 123-aa hypothetical GenBank proteins were apparent remnants of Transib TPases (approximately 40% identity to the Transib2_AG TPase, E &lt; 10-10 in BLASTP).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.58"><xcope id="X6.58.1">The RAG1 proteins <cue type="speculation" ref="X6.58.1">appeared</cue> to be more similar to the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) created by PSI-BLAST based on multiple alignment of the Transib2_AG TPase and two Transib TPase-like proteins, than to the solo Transib2_AG TPase in the BLASTP search</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.59">Given the latter observation, we decided to improve the quality of the PSSM constructed by PSI-BLAST for different Transib TPase sequences.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.60">To achieve that, we combined protein sequences of the seven known Transib TPases with the set of all GenBank proteins.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.61">As a result, Ei-values for matches of RAG1s to a new PSSM based on alignment of nine Transib TPases (the two GenBank TPase-like proteins plus seven added TPases) noticeably dropped in comparison with the Ei-values obtained for the PSSM constructed in the previous step based on alignment of the three TPases (Table 1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.62">To support the observation that Ei-values of matches between RAG1s and the Transib TPase PSSM decrease as the number of TPase sequences used for construction of the PSSM increases, we identified six new Transib TPases (Transib5, Transib3_DP, Transib4_DP, Transib1_AA, Transib2_AA, Transib3_AA; Figure S2).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.63">During the next step of the PSI-BLAST analysis, the original GenBank set was combined with 13 Transib TPases.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.64">Again, Ei-values of matches between RAG1s and the new PSSM derived from multiple alignment of 15 Transib TPases (the two GenBank proteins plus all our TPases) were much smaller (approximately 10-6–10-3; Table 1) than those obtained based on the PSSM constructed from the nine TPases at the preceding step (approximately 10-3–10-2).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.65">In the final step, we identified one more set of five new Transib TPases (Transib1_DP, Transib2_DP, Transib4_AA, Transib5_AA, and Transib1_SP).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.66">When all 18 TPases were combined with the original GenBank set, the Ei values of matches between RAG1s and the Transib PSSM dropped significantly further (10-9–10-4; Table 1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.67">During the final revision of this manuscript, we identified an intermediate RAG1-like sequence in Hydra magnipapillata, called RAG1L_HM, which is significantly similar to both RAG1 and Transib TPase, as shown later.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.68">This direct result represents an independent validation of our analysis.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.69">The PSI-BLAST PSSM of Transib TPases approximates conservation/variability of the Transib TPase consensus sequence.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.70">The more diverse the TPases used in determining the PSSM, the more accurate is the approximation; some of the insect Transib TPases are less than 30% identical to each other, as shown in Figure 2.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.71">The RAG1 Ei values decreased as the number of Transib TPases used for the PSSM construction increased due to the fact that RAG1 evolved from a Transib TPase.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.72">In all cases, the E values obtained after several rounds of iterations were less than 10-20 at the point of convergence.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.73">Nearly the entire sequences of several Transib TPases, excluding their 100–140-aa N-terminal domains, converged with an approximately 600-aa portion of RAG1 defined by positions approximately 360–1010 (Figure S3).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.74">This portion of RAG1 corresponds to the “RAG1 core,” hereafter numbered relative to human RAG1 (residues 387–1011), which along with RAG2 is known to be sufficient to perform V(D)J cleavage even after deletions of the 383-aa N-terminal and 32-aa C-terminal portions of RAG1 [19,20].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.75">During studies reported here, we identified 11 additional new families of Transib transposons and TPases (see Figure S2) that are well preserved in the genomes of fruit flies (Transib5 in D. melanogaster; and Transib1_DP, Transib2_DP, Transib3_DP, and Transib4_DP in D. pseudoobscura), mosquitoes (Transib1_AA, Transib2_AA, Transib3_AA, Transib4_AA, and Transib5_AA from A. aegypti) and sea urchin (Transib1_SP).</sentence>

				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S7.265">In our previous work using cells cultured in vitro, we showed that, as in mammals, adenosine can block proliferation and/or survival of some Drosophila cell types [16].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.266">In the present work, we have established a Drosophila model to study altered levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in vivo, and we have shown that loss of ADGF-A function causes an increase of these nucleosides in larval hemolymph.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.267">Although the adgf-a mutation leads to larval or pupal death, we have shown that this is <xcope id="X7.267.3"><cue type="negation" ref="X7.267.3">not</cue> due to the adenosine or deoxyadenosine simply blocking cellular proliferation or survival</xcope>, as the experiments in vitro <xcope id="X7.267.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X7.267.2">would</cue> <xcope id="X7.267.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X7.267.1">suggest</cue></xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.268">Rather, this mutation leads to an increase in number of hemocytes at the end of larval development due to the differentiation and release of hemocytes from the lymph glands.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.269">Hemocytes also differentiate and are released from the lymph glands during systemic infection [19].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.270">Together with our result <xcope id="X7.270.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X7.270.2">suggesting</cue> an interaction between Toll signaling and ADGF-A</xcope>, this leads to the <xcope id="X7.270.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X7.270.1">hypothesis</cue> that adenosine controls hemocyte differentiation in response to infection, and that it signals through the adenosine receptor to postpone the next developmental step, metamorphosis</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.271">This <xcope id="X7.271.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X7.271.1">would</cue> be consistent with the role of adenosine as a “stress hormone” in mammals</xcope> [6].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.272">A similar process of hemocyte differentiation and release from the lymph glands normally takes place at the onset of metamorphosis, when pupal macrophages remove histolyzing tissues.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.273">The ADGF-A promoter contains consensus binding sites for effectors of both Toll and ecdysone signaling.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.274">This <xcope id="X7.274.1"><cue type="speculation" ref="X7.274.1">raises the possibility</cue> that adenosine plays a role in the control of metamorphosis as well as in the response to stress</xcope>.</sentence>

				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S8.11">Programmed cell death has long been known to be a part of normal development, but it was not until the discovery of the first genes essential for the phenomenon that our understanding of the events leading up to the deliberate elimination of a cell began to take shape.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.12">Before this time, programmed cell death was defined by a set of specific morphological characteristics, including chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage and blebbing of the plasma membrane that could be observed in dying cells; the term apoptosis was coined to distinguish this type of cell death from necrotic deaths resulting from injury [3,4].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.13">Four genes make up the core programmed cell death pathway in C. elegans, three of which, egl-1 (egg laying abnormal), ced-3 (cell death abnormal), and ced-4, are pro-apoptotic and one, ced-9, is anti-apoptotic (reviewed in [5]).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.14">There was considerable excitement in the field when potential mammalian and Drosophila homologs for ced-3, ced-4, ced-9, and egl-1 were discovered.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.15">The CED-3 protein is one of a continuously growing family of specific cysteine proteases, termed caspases, <xcope id="X8.15.1">that are <cue type="speculation" ref="X8.15.1">thought</cue> to be the executioners of programmed cell death</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.16">At least fourteen mammalian caspases have been identified, and they are grouped into two classes on the basis of their proteolytic specificities (reviewed in [6]).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.17">Class 1 caspases are mainly involved in cytokine maturation, while Class 2 caspases act mainly in apoptosis.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.18">Class 2 has been further subdivided into two groups: upstream or initiator caspases (group 1), and downstream or effector caspases (group 2).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.19"><xcope id="X8.19.1">Initiator caspases are <cue type="speculation" ref="X8.19.1">thought</cue> to be at the beginning of a proteolytic cascade that amplifies the cell death signal and results in the activation of the effector caspases</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.20">Initiator caspases usually have long pro-domains, while effector caspases have short pro-domains.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.21">Drosophila has at least eight caspases, five of which have been at least partially characterized (Dcp-1, Dcp-2/Dredd, drICE, Dronc, and Decay) and three uncharacterized ones found encoded in the genome sequence [7].</sentence>

					<sentence id="S9.6">Dosage compensation, which ensures that the expression of X-linked genes is equal in males and females, is an essential process in organisms that have sex chromosomes.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S9.8">For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans, dosage compensation occurs in the homogametic hermaphrodite (XX) by the down-regulation of virtually all genes on the two X chromosomes by about 50%.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S9.9">In mammals, dosage compensation also occurs in the homogametic sex (the female) by X inactivation, whereby an entire X chromosome forms a distinct, heterochromatic, transcriptionally inactive nuclear structure known as the Barr body.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S9.10">Consequently, each gene on the single active X chromosome in female cells and the corresponding gene on the single X chromosome in male cells are expressed at equal levels.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S9.11">In Drosophila, dosage compensation is achieved in the heterogametic male by a twofold chromosome-wide up-regulation (hypertranscription) of essentially all genes on the single X chromosome.</sentence>
